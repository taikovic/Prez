resilience:
. Note: Organizations are evolving on the second and fourth KRI (service threat assessment and resilience testing). So I would say they are not fully mature.

Focus on critical operations and recoverability: #  or % age of disruptive events impacting critical operations to stakeholders (eg. failed SLA on strategic objectives related to key stakeholders such as customers, regulators)

Service Threat Assessment: # of %age of high risk external and internal threats (considering interconnectedness) that may result in vulnerabilities of critical operations
